## Objective

Allows users to easily create randomized color schemes for projects and websites.

## How It Works

This uses [chroma-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chroma-js) to generate colors for the user. It is displayed on a simple [astro](https://astro.build) website.

## How To Use

Clone the repo and run `npm install` to install dependencies. Then run `npm run dev` to start the dev server. You can then go to `localhost:3000` to see the site.

## How To Contribute

Feel free to fork the repo and make a pull request. I will review it and merge it if it is good.
